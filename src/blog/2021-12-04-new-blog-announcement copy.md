I am 2 years into a 3-year Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program. I've learned a few things along the way that may help others looking into grad school and MLIS programs in particular. This is a blog about library school. But it's also about how to stay relevant in the ever changing field of information science. It is a chance to reflect on the journey and share successes and failures with others.

Starting January 2022, the content I will post here every week will focus on one of four categories: Grad School Tips, Cataloging and Metadata, Book Reviews, and Technology in Libraries.

The content for Grad School Tips will cover tips and bits of knowledge I wish I had known when I started school. I'll address topics like how to choose a program, how to choose a focus, how to talk to your advisor, and how to manage your time and expectations. I'll highlight tools I have found useful, and resources I've found to supplement my coursework.

Under Cataloging and Metadata I will cover concepts and issues surrounding the description and access of information resources.

I love textbooks. Some have been more helpful than others. Book reviews is where I'll share my opinions on several resources. Once a month, I'll include a recreational book review just for fun.

One of the first things I was told in orientation for this program was employers are looking for candidates with strong technological skills. I took that to heart. Technology in Libraries is where I'll discuss different information technologies I've been learning about and projects I'm working on.

Fall 2021 semester has come to a close, and I'm looking forward to a break. I'll see you again in January! Happy Holidays, everyone!
